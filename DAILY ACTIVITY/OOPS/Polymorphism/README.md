# Method Overriding in Java (Run Time Polymorphism)
- when child class and parent class declare same method
- method name as well as parameters are also same

# super keyword
- used to refer the object of the parent class
1. accessing the data member of parent class
2. accessing the method of parent class if the method is overrided in child class

# Polymorphism
- Poly means many and morphism means forms 
- many forms but the implementation is different
- same action to be performed but in different ways
- Types:
  <br>-- Compile Time Polymorphism (static) --> Method Overloading
  <br>-- Runtime Polymorphism (dynamic) ------> Method Overriding
