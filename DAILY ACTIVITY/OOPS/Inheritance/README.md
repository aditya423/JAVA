# Inheritance
- Purpose:
  1. implement runtime polymorphism
  2. code reusability
- Terms:
  1. super class/base class/parent class
  2. subclass/child class/derived class 
- Syntax:
  <br>CPP --> class derived_class_name : access_modifier parent_class_name
  <br>JAVA -> class derived_class_name extends parent_class_name
- Types:
  1. Single Inheritance
  2. Multilevel Inheritance
  3. Hierarchical Inheritance
  4. Multiple Inheritance 
  5. Hybrid Inheritance

# Note
- JAVA does not support MULTIPLE Inheritances with classes
- In java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through INTERFACES

# Interface
- to implement 100% Abstraction
- interface is same like class but actually its not a class
- methods don't have body there we can implement in the class only
- the class that implements the interface only that class should define the methods
- the methods are abstract
- it may be variable by default they are public static and final
