# Note
- Encapsulation hides information
- Abstraction hides implementation

# Abstract Method
- method that is declared without an implementation
- methods without body

# Abstract Class
- means existing in thought or as an idea without concrete existence
- if a class includes abstract methods then class itself must be declared abstract
- we can create reference of an abstract class 
- but we can't create object of the abstract class

# Interface
- group of related methods with empty bodies
- used to implement 100% Abstraction i.e every method is abstract method
- can create properties in interfaces 
- but cannot modify properties in interfaces

# @override
- means method is taken from abstract class or interface and we are implementing it now
- it is not required to use this annotation when overriding a method

# Abstract Class VS Interface
- we can't extend multiple abstract classes 
- but we can implement multiple interfaces at a time
